Based on the work of Randy Simons, I used parts of his code in LamPI already (ported them from Arduino to Raspberry) and like to see how the Arduino libraries are now (version 1.2.0).

Trying to combine the functionality of two libraries:

1. Switch and dimmer setting
2. Read incoming 433MHz messages

At first, we'l concentrate on Kaku Messages.
If room permits on the Arduino, we'll look at other protocols as well.
